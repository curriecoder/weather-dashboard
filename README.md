## Description

This project was motivated by a desire to illustrate moment.js, javascript interactive elements, dynamic HTML content with CSS manipulation, and API calls in order to render data from a server. This project allows users to view the current weather for a given city. I learned how important it is to use innerHTML when you are dynamically generating text that needs to be read as code on this project.

## Usage

Instructions: Fill out the text field with a city name and click the 'Search' button to get real-time weather for that city and a five day forecast. The search history will populate under the search bar with clickable buttons to display that cities weather and forecast again.

I would first like to thank the instructors of UPenn LPS Coding Bootcamp class of 08-2021 for continually putting the students at the top of the importance list. Also, thanks to all of my classmates that helped me rubber duck my way through this project.
